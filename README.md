PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

"Blog Maker" is a content management system for blog posts.
The user in mind is a small business owner who has a site created by a web designer, but now they would like to add a blog page to generate more interest in their business.

"Blog Maker" allows the business owner to easily maintain their blog , creating and editing posts and tags, as well as giving them the ability to add accounts for other users to contribute to the blog. At the same time, it gives the web designer full creative control over the rest of the site (allowing them the freedom to create without relying on  Wordpress or a similar website creation platform).
